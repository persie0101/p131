    <p> <h3>I had put up a toy gun <br>
        and it was a close match <br>
        between mobilenet and google snap <br>
        but google snap had won. <br>
        Mobilenet said it was a assult gun\assult rifle <br>
        but google snap said it was an AK-47(it was). <br>
        Though both were right google snap was <br>
        more accurate.</h3> <br>
